## 100 Days Of Code

### Day 0: March 18, 2020
 
**Thoughts:** I'm very excited to accept this challenge and searched for topics and languages I want to learn the next days. Planning to start Python basics or creating portfolio website. We will see it very soon.                                                P.S. It is so hard for me to type this text because my keyboard is functioning poorly due to accidentally poured water. But I will do it no matter WHAT!!!

### Day 1: March 19, 2020, Thursday
***Today's Progress:** In progress

**Thoughts** Soon...
